awsdemo module

This module is a collection of classes, defined types, and templates to provide a demo of an end to end infrastructure deployment in AWS using the Puppetlabs/AWS module.

The PuppetLabs/AWS module just provides new types and providers to the Puppet DSL, and you could of course just use them to describe a single server, or stack of systems, or a load balancer.
